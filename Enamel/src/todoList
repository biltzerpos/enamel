to-do list:
1. add a TextView to Authoring App GUI. this textview should display String[] fileStr as indexed
similarily to any IDE. i.e.

	1. This is a text file
	2. the number followed by period is not a part of the text file
	3. the textView should also have a function scrollbar
	4. there should be a limited about of indices displayed at a time.
	5. design the dimensions of the textview as seen fit

2. use FileParser to parse var "currentFile" when "open" is clicked. Retrieve the parsed string
& save it as "fileStr". this array should be used to populate the textView described above.

3. establish controls for syntax and text inputs. e.g. ~/skip should be added to a file with a
button while "a sentence in the scenario" should be added via a text input box. the app
should check if inputs are valid and syntax is correct/will compile.
