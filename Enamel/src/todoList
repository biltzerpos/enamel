to-do list:
1. add a TextView to Authoring App GUI. this textview should display String[] fileStr as indexed
similarily to any IDE. i.e.

	1. This is a text file
	2. the number followed by period is not a part of the text file
	3. the textView should also have a function scrollbar
	4. there should be a limited about of indices displayed at a time.
	5. design the dimensions of the textview as seen fit

2. use FileParser to parse var "currentFile" when "open" is clicked. Retrieve the parsed string
& save it as "fileStr". this array should be used to populate the textView described above.

3. establish controls for syntax and text inputs. e.g. ~/skip should be added to a file with a
button while "a sentence in the scenario" should be added via a text input box. the app
should check if inputs are valid and syntax is correct/will compile. 

4. Need if statement on openFileChooser to add .txt extension to the file if not already
specified by the user.

5. please read SaveAsFile.java notes. Made functional changes to accommodate for how
writing to files work.
