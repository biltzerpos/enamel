# Authoring App
## EECS2311-Group17

## Description

This is a school project for EECS 2311 (Software Development Project). We are building a scenario builder for the TTreasure 
Box Braille (TBB) device by [The Classy Cyborgs](https://www.classycyborgs.org/). TBB is a device that helps kids learn how to 
read Braille. TBB presents Braille characters/words to the user who then responds by pressing buttons. Educators can load 
different scenarios to teach different letters and keep the kids entertained.

Our task is to write a piece of software to help educators create these scenarios. We will call it the Authoring App. The 
Authoring app will provide facilities to:
* Create the flow of the scenario (ask questions, receive answers)
* Record audio
* Save the scenario in the appropriate format
* Test the scenario using the provided software

and it has to be able to be used by visually-impared educators as well.
